## notes 2016-10-18

* @agent.vanilla requested feedback on whether google hangout meetup on data science would be useful. Provide feedback on slack.
* We may get another sub-meetup going soon  - waiting to hear back from the person - a basic R intro course, for 6 weeks.

## Todo:

Audrey’s data format problem

```
Used c <- na.locf([,2]) from {zoo} package to fill in blanks in
-- has			--wants
100  AAPL		100	AAPL
200			200	AAPL
500			500	AAPL
100 IBM		100	IBM
200			200	IBM
```

* Zach’s data munging problem
* Winston’s widget


`yo <- function(x) x`


* For debugging a series of piped (%>%) calls
    * ggplot2 stuff

* Unclear what type of data is continuous in ggplot2
    * knitr/rmarkdown walk through

* Walked through...
    * Shiny apps for real time data?
