## notes 2016-05-10

* order of events: socialize til 630ish, intro/welcome, talk about what we want to do (below), hack/open whatevs
* welcome to our first sorta unstructured pdxrlang meetup
* goals are:
    * socialize
    * job networking
    * chat if you want to chat
    * code if you want code
    * work together or alone
    * structured and unstructured time
* What do we want this sub-meetup to be like?
    * We can go back and forth between structured and un-structured


--------

For those who want a  bit more structure,  couple of ideas here, each lasting one or two meetings, and lead toward things beginners might be able to grab onto, without boring the pros.

* A  book (many choices, of course;   I liked one that combined R and analysis of basic physics experiments)
* online courses (I've been working through Coursera | Johns Hopkins sequence )
* Individual package practice (dplyr, tidy, .....)
* Graphing (ggplot2)
* Financial | Time Series data (ex:  Quandl has R interface to its public data)
* Discuss a Research Paper
* Special Topics with R(I'd like learn more about Random Walk, Bayesian Statistics)
* Big data
* Data cleaning
* Probabilistic record/data linkage
* mini talks - whenever during a meetup - get feedback, etc.
* work process/work flow
* reproducibility - connect R/data users to people that don't have experience: policy makers, etc.
* possibly start meetup with going round table with R project you're working on, or R/data science related talk you gave, etc
* some way for people to engage/contribute outside of the offiical meetup itself

## to do:

* food
* sponsors! for food, drink
* figure out how to get people engaged that have other skillsets like SQL server, etc.
* github repo for this sub-meetup (`aggregate`)
