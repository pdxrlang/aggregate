## business

* pdxrlang: https://github.com/pdxrlang
* aggregate: https://github.com/pdxrlang/aggregate
* aggregate gitter chat: https://gitter.im/pdxrlang/aggregate
* discuss ideas for the aggregate meetup: https://github.com/pdxrlang/aggregate/issues or chat about them in gitter chat
* let's go around the room...
* then we'll decide from there... a few people had ideas in the comments on this meetup

## notes

* someone runs into problems where they don't have control over their computer, can't install stuff, etc.: ideas: r-fiddle
* `xpdf` on cran requires download from homebrew, or better yet `pdftools` R package - someone scraping stuff from pdfs
* sports analytics, Ed's working on
* someone finishing up certificate at PSU in stats
* a programming problem: combining data into data.frames output from a for loop
* someone interested in time series analysis - applications with disease data
* options for hosted stuff, not necessarily R stuff: OpenCPU, Heroku, Openshift, Amazon Lambda (only JS, Python, sorta Ruby right now, any R hack out there?)

## next time

* show examples of code and get feedback - ask people to have something ready, ideally short and not too complicated
* one person was interestd in watching code on screen, good way to learn
